## Contributing and Pull Requests

When you want to contribute, clone this repository and create your own branch. Make as many commits to your branch as you want.

When ready, you can open a **Pull Request**. Alternatively, you can open a PR and convert it to a `draft` once created, to indicate an initiative and your progress.

Pull Requests are squashed, meaning you can make many commits to one PR as you'd like, but when merged into the main branch, it will be a single commit using the name of the PR.

### Naming your PR

`tag: summary in present tense`

The name of your PR should start with a tag:

- feat
- fix
- chore
- refactor
- docs
- test
- BREAKING

**Example**   `fix: giraffe cant drink water`
